### Summary
We compare on several sensible metrics the performance of ET, both as a triangle, 2 L-shaped instruments and a single L-shaped detector, in combination with CE.

### Contribution
I produced most of the numerical results and plots.

### Abstract
We study the performances of a world-wide network made by a European third-generation gravitational-wave (GW) detector, together with a 40-km Cosmic Explorer detector in the US, considering three scenarios for the European detector: (1) Einstein Telescope (ET) in its 10-km triangle configuration; (2) ET in its configuration featuring two 15-km L-shaped detectors in different sites, still taken to have all other ET characteristics (underground, and with each detector made of a high-frequency interferometer and a cryogenic low-frequency interferometer); (3) A single L-shaped underground interferometer with the ET amplitude spectral density, either with 15 km or with 20 km arm length. Overall, we find that, if a 2L configuration should be retained for ET, the network made by a single-L European underground detector together with CE-40km could already provide a very interesting intermediate step toward the construction of a full 2L+CE network, and is in any case superior to a 10-km triangle not inserted in an international network.
